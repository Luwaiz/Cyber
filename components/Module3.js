      <Text style={styles.subHeading}>Blockchain Network Architecture</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Overview:{'\n'}
        Blockchain network architecture refers to the structure and organization of nodes in a blockchain network, how they communicate, and the protocols they follow.{'\n'}
        {'\n'}
        Components:{'\n'}
        Nodes: Devices or entities participating in the blockchain network. They can be full nodes, light nodes, or miners.{'\n'}
        Network Topology: The layout of the connections and interactions between nodes. Common topologies include peer-to-peer (P2P) and client-server.{'\n'}
        Protocols: Rules and procedures that govern how data is communicated and transactions are processed in the network.{'\n'}
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.subHeading}>Nodes and Network Topology</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Nodes:{'\n'}
        Full Nodes: Maintain a complete copy of the blockchain, validate transactions and blocks, and participate in consensus.{'\n'}
        Light Nodes: Store only a subset of the blockchain and rely on full nodes for validation.{'\n'}
        Miners/Validators: Nodes that validate transactions and add them to the blockchain, earning rewards for their efforts.{'\n'}
        {'\n'}
        Network Topology:{'\n'}
        Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Each node connects directly to multiple other nodes, creating a decentralized and distributed network.{'\n'}
        Client-Server: Centralized approach where clients connect to a central server, which controls the network.{'\n'}

        {'\n'}
        Key Features:{'\n'}
        Decentralization: No single point of control or failure.{'\n'}
        Transparency: All transactions are visible to all participants.{'\n'}
        Security: Data is cryptographically secured and immutable.{'\n'}
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.subHeading}>Immutable Records</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Definition:{'\n'}
        Immutability in blockchain means that once data is written to the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted.{'\n'}
        {'\n'}
        Benefits:{'\n'}
        Data Integrity: Ensures the accuracy and reliability of data.{'\n'}
        Trust: Participants can trust that the recorded data has not been tampered with.{'\n'}

      <Text style={styles.subHeading}>Consensus Algorithms</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Purpose:{'\n'}

        {'\n'}
        Types:{'\n'}
        Proof of Work (PoW): Nodes compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The first to solve adds the block to the blockchain.{'\n'}
        Proof of Stake (PoS): Nodes are chosen to add blocks based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to "stake."{'\n'}
        Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS): Stakeholders elect delegates to validate transactions and create blocks.{'\n'}
        Proof of Authority (PoA): Validators are pre-approved and trusted entities.{'\n'}
      </Text>

      <Text style={styles.subHeading}>Smart Contracts</Text>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Definition:{'\n'}
        Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.{'\n'}
        {'\n'}
        Use Cases:{'\n'}
        Automated Transactions: Automatically execute transactions when predefined conditions are met.{'\n'}
        Decentralized Applications (DApps): Applications that run on a blockchain network without centralized control.{'\n'}
